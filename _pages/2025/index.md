## Overview
The Multimodal Food Computing (MM-FOOD) workshop explores the intersection of AI, computer vision, natural language processing, and sensory modeling in understanding food. It aims to advance multimodal methods for food recognition, recommendation, and analysis, addressing challenges in health, nutrition, and sustainability. By bringing together researchers from AI, food science, health informatics, computational social science, and human-computer interaction (HCI), this workshop fosters interdisciplinary collaboration to drive innovation in multimodal food computing.


The MM-FOOD 2025 workshop will be hosted on-site at the 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACMMM25). More information can be found <a href="https://acmmm2025.org/workshop/" target="_blank"> here</a>.
