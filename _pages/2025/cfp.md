### Submission and Review
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> All accepted papers will be included in the ACM MM Workshop proceedings series by ACM/Sheridan publishing.

We strongly encourage you to review the general ACM author guidelines <a href="https://acmmm2025.org/information-for-authors/" target="_blank">here</a>. For workshop-specific details, please read the following page very carefully.  

#### General Instructions

**ðŸ“Œ Double-blind Review:**
The MMFood'25 workshop follows the **ACM MM 2025** guidelines, including a **double-blind review process**.

**ðŸ“Œ Anonymity:**
Authors **must not** include their names, affiliations, or any identifying information in their submissions. Self-references should be written in the third person. Names will be added in the **camera-ready** version upon acceptance. 

**ðŸ“ŒarXiv Policy:**
In accordance with ACM guidelines, authors may upload preprints to **arXiv or similar non-peer-reviewed archives** before submission. However, the ACM MM 2025 review process is **double-blind**, so authors must ensure their submissions do not reveal their identity.

#### Paper Length and Format 
Workshop papers should be 4-8 pages, with up to an additional 2 pages of references. ACM Article Template is available <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">here</a>. Please remember to add Concepts and Keywords. Please use the template in traditional double-column format to prepare your submissions. For example, word users should use Word Interim Template, and LaTeX users should use sample-sigconf-authordraft template. When using sample-sigconf-authordraft template, for submission and review of manuscript you could use the following documentclass command instead of the example provided in the template: \documentclass[sigconf, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart}

Please ensure that you submit your papers subscribing to this format for full consideration during the review process.

#### Supplementary materials
By the submission deadline, the authors may optionally submit additional material that was ready at the time of paper submission but could not be included due to constraints of format or space. The authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material appropriately in the paper. Reviewers will be encouraged to look at it, but are not obligated to do so.

Supplementary material may include videos, proofs, additional figures or tables, more detailed analysis of experiments presented in the paper. There is no page limit for the supplementary materials but only one file with maximum file size of 50 MB is allowed for submission.

We encourage (if possible) authors to upload their code as part of their supplementary material in order to help reviewers assess the quality of the work.
