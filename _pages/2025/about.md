## Food Computing

Food computing is inherently multimodal, integrating vision, smell, taste, touch, and language with computational methods to acquire and analyze diverse food-related data.  
Our perception of food is shaped by multiple sensory inputs and cognitive associations, making food a uniquely multimodal experience.  

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, natural language processing, and sensory modeling have enabled new ways to recognize, retrieve, recommend, predict, and monitor food, addressing key challenges in health, nutrition, sustainability, and food culture.  

Yet, food computing remains underrepresented in the multimedia community, despite its vast potential to leverage multimodal intelligence.


## Why Multimodal Food Computing?

Food perception and decision-making involve a fusion of sensory inputs—vision, smell, taste, touch—combined with language, memory, and social influences.
Beyond personal choices, geographic, cultural, and socio-economic factors shape food systems and dietary habits, further amplified by digital communities, social media trends, and AIdriven personalization.

Despite AI’s growing role in food-related industries - from healthcare and nutrition to sustainability - ACM Multimedia lacks a dedicated regular workshop focused on
multimodal food computing (MaDiMA has been held alongside ACM MM for many years addressing some of these issues). We intend this workshop to foster interdisciplinary
collaboration among researchers in food science, AI, health informatics, computational social science, and human-computer interaction (HCI).

## Workshop Scope

This workshop will explore multimodal innovations at the intersection of:

- **Computer Vision** (e.g., food recognition, portion estimation, visual appeal analysis)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Large Language Models (LLMs)** (e.g., food descriptions, opinions, recipe generation, dietary guidelines)
- **Machine Learning & AI Planning** (e.g., personalized food recommendations, dietary adherence)
- **Sensory Science & Multisensory AI** (e.g., modeling taste, smell, texture perception)
- **Behavioral & Social Computing** (e.g., food trends, cultural influences, digital food communities)


**It will also address technical and ethical challenges, including:**

- **Data standardization** across diverse modalities (images, text, nutrition, biometrics)
- **Interpretability of AI-driven food recommendations** and their impact
- **Ensuring inclusivity** in AI-powered food solutions across populations, dietary needs, and eating cultures
